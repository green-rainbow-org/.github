# How to use this hub

![overall-flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75504552/212987268-03d4b25e-53a3-4eee-b384-55e0ffa167a8.png)

The categories for discussions are "Target users & needs," "Homepage features",  "Tech", "Polls", "Q & A", and "Actionable Goals." New discussions have comments and replies. We discuss ideas, priorities, & specific updates. Ideas are for new content or features. Prioritizing tasks moves the tasks to "on it next" and then to "on it now." In the issues we track new features, work on updates to the website, and describe and release our changes.

## [How to use Discussions][disc]

You can create new discussions within the specific topics. For now, we have the six topics I mentioned in the overview above. You can comment on discussions, and you can reply to comments. In a comment or a reply, you can select "Preview" before commenting. You can edit your comments and replies at any time. That's the end of the third chart.

Click on Projects. Then, click on the "New Web Features" Project. Then, add tasks by clicking "Add Item" within "New Content Ideas" or "New Feature Ideas." Move the tasks to "on it next," then "on it now," then "done." This tracks tasks by their progress status. When converting a task to an issue, you can assign the issue to a repository, which categorizes issues by similar topics. There are many issues within each repository. The issues can be opened or closed. Example repositories include "layout-templates", "content-creation, & "twitter-facebook."
